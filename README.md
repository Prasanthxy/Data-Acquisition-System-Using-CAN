# Abstract
  The project "Data Acquisition with CAN Communications" is designed to collect and share real-time information using modern technology. It uses two main parts: one part keeps track of the exact time using a clock system called I2C RTC, and the other part checks the room temperature using a temperature sensor that communicates through SPI. These parts then send their information over a network known as CAN bus, which is a reliable way to make sure different devices can talk to each other and share data. This project shows how combining these technologies can help us monitor and record environmental conditions accurately and efficiently, making it a useful tool for many applications that need real-time data collection.
